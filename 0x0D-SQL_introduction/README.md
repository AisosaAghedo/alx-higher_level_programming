#0x0D. SQL - Introduction
#Structured Query Language
SQL statements are divided into two major categories: data definition language (DDL) and data manipulation language (DML). Both of these categories contain far more statements than we can present here, and each of the statements is far more complex than we show in this introduction. If you want to master this material, we strongly recommend that you find a SQL reference for your own database software as a supplement to these pages.
